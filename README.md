# NBA Trends

In this project, I analyze data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) to explore possible associations.

The data was originally sourced from 538’s Analysis of the [Complete History](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#nuggets) of the NBA and includes the unmodified data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com), along with several additional variables added by 538 for their analysis.

For more information about the data and how it’s being used by 538, you can read about it [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo). In this project, I've limited the data to just 5 teams and 10 columns, with an additional constructed column named 'point_diff,' representing the difference between 'pts' and 'opp_pts'.
